title: Predicting Crop Yield with Images?
---

### Setup

First introduced into Louisiana in 1751, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) is the highest valued row-crop in the state. Its continuous production is an important historic and economic component of Louisianaâ€™s overall economy. While recent decades have seen a drop in Louisiana sugarcane acreage, crop values have remained stable due to increases in sucrose yield. Significant increases in yield are mainly attributable to the addition of nitrogen (N) fertilizer.

### Background

Our study considers the use of low-cost vegetation indices such as aerial NDVI as an addition to the overall N management scheme specific to sugarcane production in Louisiana. The Normative Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a form of hyper-spectral imaging that collects and processes information across various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. In agriculture, the goal of NDVI imaging is to detect the relative strength of photosynthetic processes occurring in the field. While vegetation indices like NDVI have been applied in agriculture, the primary disadvantage of these methods has traditionally been their cost and complexity.

 
Study Goals
Our primary goal has been to determine to what extent low-cost aerial NDVI might be correlated with variable N rates applied to sugarcane. A secondary goal is to determine to what extent time-series analysis of low-cost NDVI imagery might be used to predict yield potential in sugarcane.

We asked two questions:

    Can variable nitrogen rates applied to sugarcane be correlated with low-cost multi-spectral imagery?

    Are models of acquired multi-spectral imagery predictive of sugarcane yield?
