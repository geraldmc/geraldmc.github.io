title: Predicting Crop Yields?
---

### Background

First introduced into Louisiana in 1751, sugarcane (*Saccharum officinarum*) is the highest valued row-crop in the state. While recent decades have seen a drop in Louisiana sugarcane acreage, crop values have remained stable due to increases in sucrose yield. Significant increases in yield are attributable mainly to the addition of nitrogen (N) fertilizer.



### Introduction

What follows are results from a two-year USDA funded study that considered use of low-cost vegetation indices such as aerial NDVI as a potential addition to a sugar cane farmer's overall N management strategy. The Normative Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a form of hyper-spectral imaging that collects and processes information across various wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. In agriculture, the goal of NDVI imaging is to detect the relative strength of photosynthetic processes occurring in the field. While vegetation indices like NDVI have been applied in agriculture, the primary disadvantage of these methods has been their cost and relative complexity.

 
### Goals
Our primary goal was to determine to what extent low-cost aerial NDVI can be correlated with variable N rates applied to sugarcane. A secondary goal was to determine to what extent time-series analysis of low-cost NDVI imagery might be used to predict yield potential in sugarcane.

We asked two questions:

* Can variable nitrogen rates applied to sugarcane be correlated with low-cost multi-spectral imagery?

* Are models of acquired multi-spectral imagery predictive of sugarcane yield?

Our study area was planted and harvested over two successive growing seasons. An area of 1000 by 60 ft was divided in a Latin Square design into 30 sections.

As indicated in the image below five levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 40, 80, 120 and 180 kg·N·ac−1) were applied in a setup with six replicates. This resulted in 30 plots of size 100 × 20 sq ft each making a total trial size of 1.5 acres.
