Access MODIS Data on AWS with Python (and Luigi)

MOD09 (MODIS Surface Reflectance) is a seven-band multispectral product providing an estimate of [surface spectral reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance#Spectral_hemispherical_reflectance) for each band as it would have been measured at ground level as if there were no atmospheric scattering or absorption. It corrects for the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols.
