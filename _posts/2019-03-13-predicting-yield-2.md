### Continuation

Our project was extended over a second year after an initial season of too much rain and too little knowledge of how to acquire consistent image data. During the first year we experimented with kites, balloons and home-made cameras. The result of these efforts was a wealth of data that sufficed to show, roughly, what the health and status of a field was on a particular day. What it could not show was how one section of the crop compared to any other, or how a day compared with another next month.

In [Predicting Crop Yield - Part I](https://geraldmc.github.io/2019/03/13/predicting-yield-1/) we introduced the basics of our study without filling in the blanks. For this post and in several others to follow we'll attempt to do so.
