### Coloring the Invisible

Our project was extended over a second year after an initial season of too much rain and too little knowledge of how to acquire consistent image data. During the first year we experimented with kites, balloons and home-made cameras. The result of these efforts was a wealth of data that sufficed to show, roughly, what the health and status of a field was on a particular day. What it could not show consistently was how one section of the crop compared to another, or how one day compared with another next month.

In [Predicting Crop Yield - Part I](https://geraldmc.github.io/2019/03/13/predicting-yield-2/) we introduced the basics of our study without filling in the blanks. For the post and several to follow we'll attempt to do that.
