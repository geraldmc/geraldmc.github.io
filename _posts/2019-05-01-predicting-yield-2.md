### The Long Haul

Our project was extended over a second, and again over a third season after too much rain and too little knowledge of how to capture the image data. In the first year we experimented with kites, balloons and home-made cameras. These efforts resulted in a wealth of data that showed, if roughly, what the health and status of a sugarcane field was on a particular day. What it could not show was how one section of crop compared to any other, or how one day compared with another next month.

In [Part I](https://geraldmc.github.io/2019/05/06/predicting-yield-1/) we introduced the basics without filling in the blanks. In this post and others to follow we'll attempt to do so.
