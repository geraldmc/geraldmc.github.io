### The Long Haul

In [Part I](https://geraldmc.github.io/2019/05/06/predicting-yield-1/) we introduced the basics without filling in the blanks. In this post and others to follow we'll attempt to do so.

Our project was extended over a second and then a third season after too much rain and too little knowledge of how to capture the image data. In the first year we experimented with kites, balloons and home-made cameras. These efforts resulted in a wealth of data that showed, roughly, what the health and status of a sugarcane field was on a particular day. What it could not show was how one section of crop compared to any other, or how one day compared to the next.

### Poles Apart

One reason for our project's delay was that it had conflicting goals. On the one hand, we wanted to investigate low-cost aerial methods in agriculture. This was motivated by personal interest along with the conviction that farmers under-utilize  remote sensing technology, perhaps assuming it's too complex or expensive. On the other hand, we wanted to answer tough  questions demanding a level of precision regarding our choice of tools. 

While keen to answer questions using methods that are accessible and available at modest cost we also felt it reasonable to see how how far such methods might be pushed in answering more difficult ones. Our interest was to discover what types of vegetation index are best at correlating and predicting sugarcane yield. The first question is correlative and we assumed it would surrender to whatever method we chose. The second involved prediction and we thought it would be more difficult to answer unless the data captured was of high quality.
