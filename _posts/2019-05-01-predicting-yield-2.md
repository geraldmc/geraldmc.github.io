### The Long Haul

In [Part I](https://geraldmc.github.io/2019/05/06/predicting-yield-1/) we introduced the basics without filling in the blanks. In this post and others to follow we'll attempt to do so.

Our project was extended over a second and third season after too much rain and too little knowledge of how to capture stable images from the air. In the first year we experimented with kites, balloons and home-made cameras and produced thousands of images. This effort indicated, roughly, what the health and status of a sugarcane field was on any given day. What it could not show was how one section of crop compared to another, or how one day compared to the next.

### Poles Apart

Another reason for our project's delay was that it had conflicting goals. On the one hand, we wanted to consider low-cost aerial methods in agriculture. This was motivated by personal interest along with the conviction that farmers under-utilize remote sensing technologies, perhaps assuming they're too complex or expensive. On the other hand, we wanted to answer hard  questions that demanded a higher level of precision. 

Our interest was to discover what kinds of vegetation indexes were best at 1) correlating with and 2) predicting sugarcane yield. The first question is correlative and we assumed it would surrender to whatever method we chose (we were partly right). The second was harder. It turned out to be far more challenging than we thought unless the data captured was of much higher quality.
