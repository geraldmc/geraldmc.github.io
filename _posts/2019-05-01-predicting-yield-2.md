### The Long Haul

Our project was extended over a second, and again over a third season after too much rain and too little knowledge of how to capture image data. In the first year we experimented with kites, balloons and home-made cameras. These efforts resulted in a wealth of image data that showed, though only roughly, what the health and status of a sugarcane field was like on a particular day. What it could not show was how one section of crop compared to any other, or how oone day compared with another day next month.

In [Predicting Crop Yield - Part I](https://geraldmc.github.io/2019/03/13/predicting-yield-1/) we introduced the basics of our study without filling in the blanks. For this post and in several others to follow we'll attempt to do so.
